# Fun Programming

In this repository you can find:

- Programs written for the [Fun Programming](https://funprogramming.org) video
  tutorials: [fun-programming](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/tree/master/processing/fun-programming)
- My creative coding experiments: [processing/ideas](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/tree/master/processing/ideas).
  These are not finished work but tests I do while developing a project or experiments done just for fun and out of curiosity.
  Index below. You can view some results at https://hamoid.com and at http://hamoid.tumblr.com/archive

Most programs here are written using [Processing](http://www.processing.org/).
Some with [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).
They are great for creating static / animated / interactive graphics and sound synthesis.

My current tools include [OPENRNDR](https://openrndr.discourse.group/t/doodles-wall-c/51/3) and [GLSL](https://hamoid.com/post/in-the-mood-for-shaders/).

### Roadmap

- [x] Create thumbnails
- [x] Create a visual index
- [ ] Add tags to each sketch
- [ ] Upload my sketches, one per day. I should be done in 2020.
- [ ] Write a readme.md for each
